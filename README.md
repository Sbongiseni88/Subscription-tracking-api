# Production-ready-api
ðŸ’¼ Project Overview 
This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a production-grade backend API from the ground up, with a strong emphasis on scalability, security, and real-world business logic. The API is designed to manage user subscriptions and includes features commonly expected in enterprise-grade systems.

ðŸ”§ Key Technical Highlights
Authentication & Authorization: Implemented secure JWT-based user access control

Database Design: Modeled complex relationships using MongoDB and Mongoose

Security Best Practices: Integrated Arcjet for rate limiting and bot protection

Workflow Automation: Used Upstash to trigger smart email reminders for renewals

Robust Architecture: Built using Node.js and Express with modular routing and middleware

Deployment: Hosted on a dedicated VPS for full control and real-world deployment experience

ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters
This project goes beyond basic CRUD operations to reflect the kind of backend engineering challenges faced in production environments. It showcases:

My ability to translate business requirements into scalable backend solutions

Familiarity with modern DevOps practices and server management

A user-centered approach to API design, with validation, error handling, and performance in mind
